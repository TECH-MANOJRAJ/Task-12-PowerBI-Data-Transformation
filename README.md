# 📊 HR Employee Attrition Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🧑‍💻 Project Title  
**HR Employee Attrition Dashboard – Data Transformation using Power Query**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **data transformation and cleaning** using **Power Query in Power BI** before building dashboards.  
The dataset used is an **HR Employee Attrition dataset**, which includes employee details such as age, salary, job role, and attrition status.

The objective of this task is to showcase:
- Data preprocessing  
- Data transformation  
- Creation of derived columns  
- Basic dashboarding using transformed data

## 🗂 Dataset  
**IBM HR Employee Attrition Dataset**  
File: `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query Editor  
- Microsoft Excel (optional)

## 🔄 Data Transformation Steps  

1. Imported the dataset into Power BI.  
2. Opened Power Query Editor for transformations.  
3. Removed unnecessary columns (EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours).  
4. Renamed columns for better readability (e.g., MonthlyIncome → Salary, JobRole → Job Role).  
5. Checked and handled missing values.  
6. Changed data types appropriately for numeric and text columns.  
7. Created **Age Group** column using conditional logic (Young, Mid Age, Senior).  
8. Created **Salary Band** column using conditional logic (Low, Medium, High).  
9. Removed duplicate records using EmployeeNumber.  
10. Loaded the transformed data into the Power BI model.
