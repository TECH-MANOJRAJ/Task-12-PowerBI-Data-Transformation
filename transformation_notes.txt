1. Loaded the HR Employee Attrition dataset into Power BI using Text/CSV option.

2. Opened Power Query Editor to perform data transformation.

3. Removed unnecessary columns such as EmployeeCount, Over18, and StandardHours to reduce noise.

4. Renamed important columns for better readability (MonthlyIncome renamed to Salary, JobRole renamed to Job Role).

5. Checked for missing values across all columns and replaced or handled them appropriately.

6. Changed data types of columns such as Age and Salary to numeric types and Attrition to text type.

7. Created a new derived column called "Age Group" using conditional logic:
   - Age < 30 → Young
   - Age 30–50 → Mid Age
   - Age > 50 → Senior

8. Created another derived column called "Salary Band" using conditional logic:
   - Salary < 3000 → Low
   - Salary 3000–7000 → Medium
   - Salary > 7000 → High

9. Removed duplicate records using EmployeeNumber to ensure each row represents a unique employee.

10. Applied and loaded the transformed dataset into the Power BI data model for visualization.

11. Built basic visuals using transformed data including Attrition distribution, Age Group analysis, and Salary by Job Role.
